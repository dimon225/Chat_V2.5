<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Client class basically connects to the server if server is online of course
 if not the client will receive a message saying server is offline this client application
 can save the conversations or clear them talk to other connected clients can send smiley to others
 Basically its a JFrame with that has all needed components to represent itself graphically on the screen
 Client first has to login to the server server has to be online or the exception will be thrown then caught
 the message Server offline will appear in the textPane The Client has a JList of all students that are connected
 simply by selecting the appropriate student and then right clicking the mouse the popup will appear with two choices
 go private chat or transfer files selecting the private chat option will popup the private chat window with the start button
 by clicking the button the connection will be established between two client private chat is 100% private no server involvement
 The client can also choose another port or IP address if server changes its IP client can also add smiley for fun send them to others
 The protocol that client uses to unwrap the objects is very straight forward instance variables of the serialized object are either null
 or not null if not null the information is extracted and used accordingly by calling needed methods depending on what was received
 the client class has a lot methods that are called on different times the configuration file that saves automatically the port and the IP
 of the server is loaded automatically if the file exists if not it will ask the IP and port number</TD>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CostumPanel class is JPanel and a bit more
 instead overriding the paintComponent method of each panel i want to paint
 i have decided to have the CostumPanel that will receive path to the image
 and paint itself accordingly</TD>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FileTransferPanel is the panel on the bottom right corner of the
 private chat window it basically needed to transfer files back and forth between clients
 if one of the clients wants to send a file he/she must click on the send file button which in turn
 pops up the JFileChooser the client selects the file he/she wants to send then clicks on the approve button
 of the file chooser that will send a message to the other guy for approval if he wants to get file he clicks yes
 otherwise he clicks no if yes is clicked the IP address of the client that is sending is extracted from the sent object
 creates a socket and connects to already listening server which is the client that is sending the file if no is clicked the message indicating
 of the disapproval is sent back to the client that sending the file in turn his socket will be closed and he will receive notification
 that his file was refused for downloading</TD>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Packet class is the Serializable class that we use to send information
 back and forth between clients and server when we want to send something we
 simply set the appropriate variables to not null meaning message or else when the other guy receives it
 extracts it and displays it the way he wants depending on the packet contents it is not always a message</TD>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PrivateChatWindow class is private chat window that pops up if the
 user wants to talk privately to another user when the window is running my private chat is really private
 the button start private chat should be clicked it sends a message to the server
 to get the IP address of the user that you chose to privately chat with
 The server has a map that maps the names to the IP addresses the IP address is extracted then
 it is forwarded to the client that you invite in the private chat that IP in turn will be used
 to create a socket with the IP received to connect to the private chat of the guy that invited the client
 to private chat because as soon as the button start private chat is hit the inviter starts to listen to
 connections in turn its name is forwarded to the server which extracts the IP sends it the other guy
 which creates a socket and connects to already listening server of the private chat</TD>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PublicFileTransfer class is used to transfer file through the public chat
 my chat application has two possibilities you can either transfer files through a private chat
 or you can transfer through the public chat which one you use its upto you as a user
 This class has a simple GUI graphical user interface to let the user know that the file is being transfered
 and how many percent are left.</TD>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ServerGUI class is the Graphical Interface of the Server Side of our
 Chat project when it starts up it waits for the administrator to click the button start
 as soon as the button start is clicked the server starts to listen on the Server Thread which is the inner class
 of the ServerGUI The server has all the possibilities it can view the conversations it can kick people out
 then it can also send private messages to the clients as well as it can broadcast important messages to all connected clients
 This message will be of color red so clients will see them as being important the Administrator can also clear its own conversations
 The Administrator have the power to disconnect and ban user by inserting their IP into the black list of IPs
 The ServerGUI has also a JList that has contains all connected clients for controlling the clients by sending them messages etc.....</TD>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Server class is a Runnable object it listens for
 any connections when connection is established the Session object is created
 It is also added to the list of sessions because server needs to remember all connected session
 for later communication with clients and etc......</TD>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Session class is the session between Client and Server this object is the Thread
 Each time that the object of this type is created it runs in its own thread
 It receives the object from the client analyzes it then does what is needed
 if the object contains message it broadcasts the message to all connected clients
 There also could be objects for private chat request and etc........</TD>
